# Launch Modes

Triton Model Analyzer's `profile` subcommand supports four different launch
modes along with Triton Inference Server. In the `local` and `docker` modes,
Triton Inference Server will be launched by the Model Analyzer. In the `c_api`
mode, the Triton Inference Server is launched locally via a C API. In the
`remote` mode, it is assumed there is an already running instance of Triton
Inference Server.

### Local

| CLI Option | **`--triton-launch-mode=local`** |
| - | - |

In this mode, Model Analyzer will launch Triton Server using the local binary
supplied using `--triton-server-path`, or if none is supplied, the
`tritonserver` binary in `$PATH`.

Local mode is the recommended method of getting started with Model Analyzer.
There are detailed instructions about using this mode in the
[Quick Start Guide](quick_start.md).

### Docker

| CLI Option | **`--triton-launch-mode=docker`** |
| - | - |

In this mode, Model Analyzer uses the Python Docker API to launch the Triton
Inference Server container. If you are running Model Analyzer inside a Docker
container, make sure that the container is launched with appropriate flags. The
following flags are mandatory for correct behavior:

```
--gpus <gpus> -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --net host
```

Additionally, Model Analyzer uses the `output_model_repository_path` to
manipulate and store model config variants. When Model Analyzer launches the
Triton container, it does so as a *sibling container*. The launched Triton
container will only have access to the host filesystem. **As a result, in the
docker launch mode, the output model directory will need to be mounted to the
Model Analyzer docker container at the same absolute path it has outside the
container.** So you must add the following when you launch the model analyzer
container as well.

```
-v <path-to-output-model-repository>:<path-to-output-model-repository>
```

Finally, when launching model analyzer, the argument `--output-model-repository`
must be provided as a directory inside `<path-to-output-model-repository>`. This
directory need not exist. 

```
--output-model-repository=<path-to-output-model-repository>/output
```

This mode is useful if you want to use the Model Analyzer installed in the
Triton SDK Container. You will need Docker installed, though.

### C API

| CLI Option | **`--triton-launch-mode=c_api`** |
| - | - |

In this mode, Triton server is launched locally via the
[C_API](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/inference_protocols.md#c-api)
by the perf_analyzer instances launched by Model Analyzer.

This mode is useful if you want to run with the Triton Server installed locally
and want the increased performance from the C API. Similar to the
[local mode](#local), Triton Server must be installed in the environment that
the Model Analyzer is being used.

### Remote

| CLI Option | **`--triton-launch-mode=remote`** |
| - | - |

This mode is beneficial when you want to use an already running Triton Inference
Server. You may provide the URLs for the Triton instance's HTTP or GRPC endpoint
depending on your chosen client protocol using the `--triton-grpc-endpoint`, and
`--triton-http-endpoint` flags. You should also make sure that same GPUs are
available to the Inference Server and Model Analyzer and they are on the same
machine. Model Analyzer does not currently support profiling remote GPUs. Triton
Server in this mode needs to be launched with `--model-control-mode explicit`
flag to support loading/unloading of the models. The model parameters cannot be
changed in remote mode, though.
