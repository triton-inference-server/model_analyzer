# Configuring Model Analyzer

Each subcommand in the Model Analyzer can be configured with a
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) file or via the command line interface (CLI). Every
flag supported by the CLI is supported in the configuration file, but some
configurations are only supported using the config file.

The placeholders below are used throughout the configuration:

* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take `true` or `false` as value.
* `<string>`: a regular string
* `<comma-delimited-list>`: a list of comma separated items.
* `<int>`: a regular integer value.
* `<list>`: a list of values.
* `<range>`: An object containing `start` and `stop` key with an optional `step`
  value. If `step` is not defined, we use 1 as the default value for `step`. The
  types that support `<range>` can be described by a list or using the example
  structure below:
```yaml
batch_sizes:
    start: 2
    stop: 6
    step: 2
```

The above YAML declares the value of batch_sizes to be an array `[2, 4, 6]`.

The following sections describe the configuration options for each of the
subcommands of the Model Analyzer.
## Config options for `profile`
### CLI and YAML Config Options

A list of all the configuration options supported by both the CLI and YAML
config file are shown below. Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For
non-list and non-object parameters the value is set to the specified default.

The CLI flags corresponding to each of the options below are obtained by
converting the `snake_case` options to `--kebab-case`. For example,
`profile_models` in the YAML would be `--profile-models` in the CLI.


```yaml

```

## Config Options for `report`
### CLI and YAML options

The config options for the `report` subcommand supported by both the CLI and
YAML config file are shown below. Brackets indicate that a parameter is
optional. For non-list and non-object parameters the value is set to the
specified default.

```yaml

```yaml

# yaml config section for each model config for which to generate detailed reports.
report_model_configs: <comma-delimited-string-list|list|report_model_config>

# yaml sections to configure the plots that should be shown in the detaild report
[ plots: <dict-plot-configs> | default: See Config Defaults section ]

```

## Field Descriptions

Before proceeding, it will be helpful to see the documentation on [Model Analyzer Metrics](./metrics.md) regarding what metric tags are and how to use them.
### `<constraint>`
A constraint, specifies the bounds that determine a successful run. There are
three constraints allowed:

| Option Name       |   Units   | Constraint | Description                                          |
| :---------------- | :-------: | :--------: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `perf_throughput` | inf / sec |    min     | Specify minimum desired throughput.                  |
| `perf_latency`    |    ms     |    max     | Specify maximum tolerable latency or latency budget. |
| `gpu_used_memory` |    MB     |    max     | Specify maximum GPU memory used by model.            |


#### Examples

To filter out the results when `perf_throughput` is less than 5 infer/sec:

```yaml
perf_throughput:
    min: 5
```

To filter out the results when `perf_latency` is larger than 100 milliseconds:

```yaml
perf_latency:
    max: 100
```

To filter out the results when `gpu_used_memory` is larger than 200 MBs:
```yaml
gpu_used_memory:
    max: 200
```

Keys can be combined for more complex constraints:
```yaml
gpu_used_memory:
    max: 200
perf_latency:
    max: 100
```

This will filter out the results when `gpu_used_memory` is larger than 200 MBs
and their latency is larger than 100 milliseconds.

The values described above can be specified both globally and on a per model
basis.

The global example looks like below:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
analysis_models:
  - model_1
  - model_2

constraints:
    gpu_used_memory:
        max: 200
```

In the global mode, the constraint specified will be enforced on every model. To
have different constraints for each model, version below can be used:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
analysis_models:
  model_1:
    constraints:
        gpu_used_memory:
            max: 200
  model_2:
    constraints:
        perf_latency:
            max: 50
```

### `<objective>`

Objectives specify the sorting criteria for the final results. The fields below
are supported under this object type:

| Option Name       | Description                                            |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `perf_throughput` | Use throughput as the objective.                       |
| `perf_latency`    | Use latency as the objective.                          |
| `gpu_used_memory` | Use GPU memory used by the model as the objective.     |
| `gpu_free_memory` | Use GPU memory not used by the model as the objective. |
| `gpu_utilization` | Use the GPU utilization as the objective.              |
| `cpu_used_ram`    | Use RAM used by the model as the objective.            |
| `cpu_free_ram`    | Use RAM not used by the model as the objective.        |

An example `objectives` that will sort the results by throughput looks like
below:

```yaml
objectives:
- perf_throughput
```

To sort the results by latency, `objectives` should look like:

```yaml
objectives:
- perf_latency
```
#### Weighted Objectives

In addition to the mode discussed above, multiple values can be provided in the
objectives key in order to provide more generalized control over how model
analyzer sorts results. For example:

```yaml
objectives:
- perf_latency
- perf_throughput
```

The above config is telling model analyzer to compare two measurements by
finding relative gain from one measurement to the other, and computing the
weighted average of this gain across all listed metrics. In the above example,
the relative weights for each metric is equal by default. So if we have two
measurements of latency and throughput, model analyzer employs the following
logic:

```python
measurement_A = (latency_A, throughput_A)
measurement_B = (latency_B, throughput_B)

gain_A_B = (latency_A - latency_B, throughput_A - throughput_B)

weighted_average_gain = 0.5*(latency_A - latency_B) + 0.5*(throughput_A - throughput_B)
```

If `weighted_average_gain` exceeds a threshold then `measurement_A` is declared
to be "better" than `measurement_B`. Model Analyzer will automatically account
for metrics in which less is better and those which more is better.

An extension of the above `objectives` is explicitly specifying the weights. For
example:
```yaml
objectives:
    perf_latency: 2
    perf_throughput: 3
```

The score for each measurement will be a weighted average using the weights
specified here. The above config will tell Model Analyzer to multiply the
throughput gain by `0.4` and latency gain by by `0.6`.

The `objectives` section can be specified both globally and on a per model
basis.

### Test Configuration `<parameter>`

A user can specify a range of test configurations that Model Analyzer will
profile over. The possible configuration parameters are `concurrency` and
`batch_sizes`. One or more parameters are specified per model only. Parameters
cannot be specified globally.

Options available under this parameter are described in table below:

| Option Name   | Description                                             | Supporting Types                                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `concurrency` | Request concurrency used for generating the input load. | `<range>`, `<comma-delimited-list>`, or a `<list>` |
| `batch_sizes` | Static batch size used for generating requests.         | `<range>`, `<comma-delimited-list>`, or a `<list>` |


An example `<parameter>` looks like below:

```yaml
parameters:
    concurrency:
        start: 2
        stop: 64
        step: 8
    batch_sizes: 1,2,3
```

A complete config example looks like below:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
profile_models:
  model_1:
    parameters:
        concurrency:
            start: 2
            stop: 64
            step: 8
        batch_sizes: 1,2,3
```

These parameters will result in testing the concurrency configurations of 2, 10,
18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, and 64, for each of different batch sizes of 1, 2 and 3.
This will result in 27 individual test runs of the model.

### `<model-config-parameters>`

This field represents the values that can be changed or swept through using
Model Analyzer. All the values supported in the [Triton
Config](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md)
can be specified or swept through here. `<model-config-parameters>`  should be
specified on a per model basis and cannot be specified globally (like
`<parameter>`).

Table below presents the list of common parameters that can be used for manual
sweeping:

|                                                              Option                                                              |                                                                                                                                                               Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| [`dynamic_batching`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md#dynamic-batcher)  |                                                                                              Dynamic batching is a feature of Triton that allows inference requests to be combined by the server, so that a batch is created dynamically.                                                                                               |
| [`max_batch_size`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md#maximum-batch-size) |                                       The max_batch_size property indicates the maximum batch size that the model supports for the [types of batching](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#models-and-schedulers) that can be exploited by Triton.                                       |
|  [`instance_group`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md#instance-groups)   | Triton can provide multiple instances of a model so that multiple inference requests for that model can be handled simultaneously. The model configuration ModelInstanceGroup property is used to specify the number of execution instances that should be made available and what compute resource should be used for those instances. |

An example `<model-config-parameters>` look like below:
```yaml
model_config_parameters:
    max_batch_size: [6, 8]
    dynamic_batching:
        preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2], [3]]
        max_queue_delay_microseconds: [200, 300]
    instance_group:
    -
        kind: KIND_GPU
        count: [1, 2]
```

Note that for values that accept a list by default the user needs to specify an
additional list if want to sweep through it. Otherwise, it will only change the
original model config to the value specified and it will not sweep through it.
`preferred_batch_size` is an example for this. To read more about the automatic
config search, checkout [Config Search](./config_search.md) docs.

A complete `profile` YAML config looks like below:
```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/

run_config_search_disable: True
profile_models:
  model_1:
    model_config_parameters:
        max_batch_size: 2
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [1, 2, 3]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            kind: KIND_GPU
            count: 1
        -
            kind: KIND_CPU
            count: 1
```

Note that in the above configuration, it will not sweep through any of the
parameters. The reason is that both `instance_group` and `preferred_batch_size`
accept a list by default. Sweeping thorough different parameters can be achieved
using the configuration below:
```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/

run_config_search_disable: True
profile_models:
  model_1:
    model_config_parameters:
        max_batch_size: 2
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2], [3]]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_GPU
                count: 1
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_CPU
                count: 1
```

This will lead to 6 different configurations (3 different preferred batch sizes
and two instance group combinations). If both `model_config_parameters` and
`parameters` keys are specified, the list of sweep configurations will be the
cartesian product of both of the lists.

### `<perf-analyzer-flags>`

This field allows fine-grained control over the behavior of the `perf_analyzer`
instances launched by Model Analyzer. `perf_analyzer` options and their values
can be specified here, and will be passed to `perf_analyzer`. Refer to [the
`perf_analyzer`
docs](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/perf_analyzer.md)
for more information on these options.

#### Example

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/
profile_models:
  model_1:
    perf_analyzer_flags:
        percentile: 95
        latency_report_file: /path/to/latency/report/file
```

The `perf_analyzer_flags` section can also be specified globally to affect
perf_analyzer instances across all models in the following way:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/
profile_models:
  model_1:
    parameters:
        batch_sizes: 4
perf_analyzer_flags:
    percentile: 95
    latency_report_file: /path/to/latency/report/file
```

**Important Notes**: 
* The Model Analyzer also provides certain arguments to the `perf_analyzer`
  instances it launches. These ***cannot*** be overriden by providing those
  arguments in this section. An example of this is `perf_measurement_window`,
  which is an argument to Model Analyzer itself.

### `<triton-server-flags>`

This section of the config allows fine-grained control over the flags passed to
the Triton instances launched by Model Analyzer when it is running in the
`docker` or `local` Triton launch modes. Any argument to the server can be
specified here.

#### Example

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/
profile_models:
  model_1:
    parameters:
        batch_sizes:
            start: 4
            stop: 9
        concurrency:
            - 2
            - 4
            - 8
triton_server_flags:
    strict_model_config: False
    log_verbose: True
```

Since Model Analyzer relaunches Triton Server each time a model config is
loaded, you can also specify `triton_server_flags` on a per model basis. For
examples:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/
profile_models:
  model_1:
    triton_server_flags:
        strict_model_config: False
        log_verbose: True
  model_1:
    triton_server_flags:
        exit_timeout_secs: 120
```

**Important Notes**: 
* The Model Analyzer also provides certain arguments to the `tritonserver`
  instances it launches. These ***cannot*** be overriden by providing those
  arguments in this section. An example of this is `http-port`, which is an
  argument to Model Analyzer itself.

### `<plots>`

This section is used to specify the kind of plots that will be displayed in the
detailed report. The section is structured as a list of `<plot>` objects as
follows:

```yaml
plots:
  plot_name_1:
    title: Title
    x_axis: perf_latency
    y_axis: perf_throughput
    monotonic: True
  plot_name_2:
    .
    .
    .
```

Each `<plot>` object consists of the `plot_name` which is also the name of the
file to which the plot will be saved as a `.png`. Each plot object also requires
specifying each of the following:
* `title` : The title of the plot
* `x_axis` : The metric tag for the metric that should appear in the x-axis,
  e.g. `perf_latency`. The plotted points are also sorted by the values of this
  metric.
* `y_axis` : The metric tag for the metric that should appear in the y-axis. 
* `monotonic` : Some plots may require consecutive points to be strictly
  increasing. A boolean value of `true` can be specified here to require this.

## `<profile-model>`
The `--profile-models` argument can be provided as a list of strings (names of
models) from the CLI interface, or as a more complex `<profile-model>` object
but only through the YAML configuration file. The model object can contain
`<model-config-parameters>`, `<parameter>`,
`<perf-analyzer-flags>`,`<triton-server-flags>` and a flag `cpu_only`.

A profile model object puts together all the different parameters specified
above. An example will look like:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/

run_config_search_disable: True
profile_models:
  model_1:
    perf_analyzer_flags:
        percentile: 95
        latency_report_file: /path/to/latency/report/file
    model_config_parameters:
        max_batch_size: 2
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2], [3]]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_GPU
                count: 1
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_CPU
                count: 1
    parameters:
        concurrency:
            start: 2
            stop: 64
            step: 8
        batch_sizes: 1,2,3
```

Multiple models can be specified under the `profile_models` key.

 #### Example

An example configuration looks like below:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
run_config_search_disable: true
triton_launch_mode: docker
profile_models:
  vgg_19_graphdef:
    parameters:
        batch_sizes: 1, 2, 3
    model_config_parameters:
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [[2], [3]]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_CPU
                count: 1
    vgg_16_graphdef:
      parameters:
        concurrency:
            start: 2
            stop: 64
            step: 8
      model_config_parameters:
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2]]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_GPU
                count: 1
batch_sizes:
    start: 4
    stop: 9
concurrency:
    - 2
    - 4
    - 8
```

If this file is saved to the `config.yml`, Model Analyzer can be started using
the `-f`, or `--config-file` flag.

```
model-analyzer -f config.yml
```

It will run the model `vgg_19_graphdef` over combinations of batch sizes
`[1,2,3]`, `concurrency` `[2,4,8]` (taken from the global concurrency section),
with dynamic batching enabled and preferred batch sizes `2` and `3` and a single
CPU instance.

It will also run the model `vgg_16_graphdef` over combinations of batch sizes
`[4,5,6,7,8,9]`(taken from the global `batch_sizes` section), concurrency
`[2,10,18,26,34,42,50,58]`, with dynamic batching enabled and preferred batch
sizes `1` and `2` and a single GPU instance.

## `<analysis-model>`
The `--analysis-models` argument can be provided as a list of strings (names of
models) from the CLI interface, or as a more complex `<analysis-model>` object
but only through the YAML configuration file. The model object can contain
`<objectives>` and `<constraints>`. An example looks like:

```yaml
analysis_models:
  model_1:  
    constraints:
        gpu_used_memory:
            max: 200
    objectives:
    - perf_throughput
```

Multiple models can be specified under the `analysis_models` key as well.

```yaml
analysis_models:
  model_1:  
    constraints:
        gpu_used_memory:
            max: 200
  model_1:  
    constraints:
        perf_latency:
            max: 80
objectives:
- perf_throughput
```

## `<report-model-config>`
The `--report-model-configs` argument can be provided as a list of strings
(names of models) from the CLI interface, or as a more complex
`<report-model-config>` object but only through the YAML configuration file. The
model object can contain `<plots>` objects. An example looks like:

```yaml
report_model_configs:
  model_1_i0:
    throughput_v_latency:
      title: Title
      x_axis: perf_latency
      y_axis: perf_throughput
      monotonic: True
```

Multiple models can be specified under the `analysis_models` key as well.

```yaml
report_model_configs:
  model_1_i0:
    throughput_v_latency:
        title: Title
        x_axis: perf_latency
        y_axis: perf_throughput
        monotonic: True
  model_2_i0:
    gpu_mem_v_latency:
        title: Title
        x_axis: perf_latency
        y_axis: gpu_used_memory
        monotonic: False
```
