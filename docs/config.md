# Model Analyzer Config

The Model Analyzer can be configured with a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file.
The scheme for the configuration file is described below. Brackets indicate
that a parameter is optional. For non-list and non-object parameters the
value is set to the specified default.

Every flag supported by the CLI is supported in the configuration file.
But some configurations are only supported using the config file.

The placeholders below are used throughout the configuration:

* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take `true` or `false` as value.
* `<string>`: a regular string
* `<comma-delimited-list>`: a list of comma separated items.
* `<int>`: a regular integer value.
* `<list>`: a list of values.
* `<range>`: An object containing `start` and `stop` key with an optional
`step` value. If `step` is not defined, we use 1 as the default value for
`step`. The types that support `<range>` can be described by a list or using
the example structure below:
```yaml
batch_sizes:
    start: 2
    stop: 6
    step: 2
```

This YAML represents the array `[2, 4, 6]`.
* Other types are described in the end of this file.

```

## `<constraint>`
A constraint, specifies the bounds that determine a successful run. There are
three constraints allowed:

| Option Name       |   Units   | Constraint | Description                                          |
| :---------------- | :-------: | :--------: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `perf_throughput` | inf / sec |    min     | Specify minimum desired throughput.                  |
| `perf_latency`    |    ms     |    max     | Specify maximum tolerable latency or latency budget. |
| `gpu_used_memory` |    MB     |    max     | Specify maximum GPU memory used by model.            |


### Examples

To filter out the results when `perf_throughput` is
less than 5 infer/sec:

```yaml
perf_throughput:
    min: 5
```

To filter out the results when `perf_latency` is larger than 100
milliseconds:

```yaml
perf_latency:
    max: 100
```

To filter out the results when `gpu_used_memory` is larger than 200
MBs:
```yaml
gpu_used_memory:
    max: 200
```

Keys can be combined for more complex constraints:
```yaml
gpu_used_memory:
    max: 200
perf_latency:
    max: 100
```

This will filter out the results when `gpu_used_memory` is larger than 200 MBs and
their latency is larger than 100 milliseconds.

The values described above can be specified both globally and on a per model basis.

The global example looks like below:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
model_names:
  - model_1
  - model_2

constraints:
    gpu_used_memory:
        max: 200
```

In the global mode, the constraint specified will be enforced on every model.
To have different constraints for each model, version below can be used:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
model_names:
  model_1:
    constraints:
        gpu_used_memory:
            max: 200
  model_2:
    constraints:
        latency:
            max: 50
```

## `<objective>`

Objectives specify the sorting criteria for the final results.
The fields below are supported under this object type:

| Option Name       | Description                                            |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `perf_throughput` | Use throughput as the objective.                       |
| `perf_latency`    | Use latency as the objective.                          |
| `gpu_used_memory` | Use GPU memory used by the model as the objective.     |
| `gpu_free_memory` | Use GPU memory not used by the model as the objective. |
| `gpu_utilization` | Use the GPU utilization as the objective.              |
| `cpu_used_ram`    | Use RAM used by the model as the objective.            |
| `cpu_free_ram`    | Use RAM not used by the model as the objective.        |

An example `objectives` that will sort the results by throughput looks like below:

```yaml
objectives:
- perf_throughput
```

To sort the results by latency, `objectives` should look like:

```yaml
objectives:
- perf_latency
```
### Weighted Objectives

In addition to the mode discussed above, multiple values can be provided in
the objectives key. For example:

```yaml
objectives:
- perf_latency
- perf_throughput
```

The above config will multiply obtained throughput and latency for each
measurement by 0.5 (i.e. 0.5 * latency + 0.5 * throughput) and use this as
the "score" to sort the measurements according to. This mode can be useful
if a more advanced criteria needs to be used for sorting.

An extension of the above `objectives` is explicitly specifying the weights.
For example:
```yaml
objectives:
    perf_latency: 2
    perf_throughput: 3
```

The score for each measurement will be a weighted average using the weights
specified here. The above config will multiply obtained throughput by 0.4 and
latency by 0.6 and use the sum as the score for the measurement.

`<objective>` can be specified both globally and on a per model basis.

## Test Configuration `<parameter>`

A user can specify a range of test configurations that Model Analyzer will
profile over. The possible configuration parameters are `concurrency` and
`batch_sizes`. One or more parameters are specified per model only. Parameters
cannot be specified globally.

Options available under this parameter are described in table below:

| Option Name   | Description                                             | Supporting Types                                   |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `concurrency` | Request concurrency used for generating the input load. | `<range>`, `<comma-delimited-list>`, or a `<list>` |
| `batch_sizes` | Static batch size used for generating requests.         | `<range>`, `<comma-delimited-list>`, or a `<list>` |


An example `<parameter>` looks like below:

```yaml
parameters:
    concurrency:
        start: 2
        stop: 64
        step: 8
    batch_sizes: 1,2,3
```

A complete config example looks like below:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
model_names:
  model_1:
    parameters:
        concurrency:
            start: 2
            stop: 64
            step: 8
        batch_sizes: 1,2,3
```

These parameters will result in testing the concurrency configurations of 2,
10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, and 64, for each of different batch sizes of 1, 2
and 3. This will result in 27 individual test runs of the model.

## `<model-config-parameters>`

This field represents the values that can be changed or swept through
using Model Analyzer. All the values supported in the [Triton
Config](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md)
can be specified or swept through here. `<model-config-parameters>`  should be
specified on a per model basis and cannot be specified globally (like `<parameter>`).

Table below presents the list of common parameters that can be used for manual sweeping:

|                                                              Option                                                              |                                                                                                                                                               Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| [`dynamic_batching`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md#dynamic-batcher)  |                                                                                              Dynamic batching is a feature of Triton that allows inference requests to be combined by the server, so that a batch is created dynamically.                                                                                               |
| [`max_batch_size`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md#maximum-batch-size) |                                       The max_batch_size property indicates the maximum batch size that the model supports for the [types of batching](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#models-and-schedulers) that can be exploited by Triton.                                       |
|  [`instance_group`](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/master/docs/model_configuration.md#instance-groups)   | Triton can provide multiple instances of a model so that multiple inference requests for that model can be handled simultaneously. The model configuration ModelInstanceGroup property is used to specify the number of execution instances that should be made available and what compute resource should be used for those instances. |

An example `<model-config-parameters>` look like below:
```yaml
model_config_parameters:
    max_batch_size: [6, 8]
    dynamic_batching:
        preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2], [3]]
        max_queue_delay_microseconds: [200, 300]
    instance_group:
    -
        kind: KIND_GPU
        count: [1, 2]
```

Note that for values that accept a list by default the user needs to specify
an additional list if want to sweep through it. Otherwise, it will only
change the original model config to the value specified and it will not sweep
through it. `preferred_batch_size` is an example for this. To read more about
the automatic config search, checkout [Config Search](./config_search.md)
docs.

A complete YAML config looks like below:
```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/

run_config_search_disable: True
model_names:
  model_1:
    model_config_parameters:
        max_batch_size: 2
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [1, 2, 3]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            kind: KIND_GPU
            count: 1
        -
            kind: KIND_CPU
            count: 1
```

Note that in the above configuration, it will not sweep through any of the parameters. The
reason is that both `instance_group` and `preferred_batch_size` accept a list by default.
Sweeping thorough different parameters can be achieved using the configuration below:
```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/

run_config_search_disable: True
model_names:
  model_1:
    model_config_parameters:
        max_batch_size: 2
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2], [3]]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_GPU
                count: 1
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_CPU
                count: 1
```

This will lead to 6 different configurations (3 different preferred batch
sizes and two instance group combinations). If both
`model_config_parameters` and `parameters` keys are specified, the list of sweep
configurations will be the cartesian product of both of the lists.

## `<model>`
The model object can contain `<constraint>`, `<objective>`,
`<model-config-parameters>`, and `<parameter>`.

A model object puts together all the different parameters specified above. An example
will look like:
```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model/repository/

run_config_search_disable: True
model_names:
  model_1:
    model_config_parameters:
        max_batch_size: 2
        dynamic_batching:
            preferred_batch_size: [[1], [2], [3]]
            max_queue_delay_microseconds: 200
        instance_group:
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_GPU
                count: 1
        -
            -
                kind: KIND_CPU
                count: 1
    parameters:
        concurrency:
            start: 2
            stop: 64
            step: 8
        batch_sizes: 1,2,3
    constraints:
        gpu_used_memory:
            max: 200
    objectives:
    - perf_throughput
```

Multiple models can be specified under the `model_names` key.

 ## Example

An example configuration looks like below:

```yaml
model_repository: /path/to/model-repository
triton_launch_mode: docker
model_names:
  - vgg_19_graphdef

batch_sizes:
    start: 4
    stop: 9
concurrency:
    - 2
    - 4
    - 8
```

If this file is saved to the `config.yml`, 
Model Analyzer can be started using the `-f`, or `--config-file` flag.

```
model-analyzer -f config.yml
```

This config will analyze the models using batch sizes equal
to `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and concurrency values equal to
`[2, 4, 8]`.  `step` value
for batch size can also be specified to change the step size.
