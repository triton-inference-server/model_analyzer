        Constructor

        handle is an existing handle from dcgmInit(). Pass None if you want this object to handle DCGM initialization for you
        ipAddress is the host to connect to. None = start embedded host engine
        opMode is a dcgm_structs.DCGM_OPERATION_MODE_* constant for how the host engine should run (embedded mode only)
        persistAfterDisconnect (TCP-IP connections only) is whether the host engine should persist all of our watches
                               after we disconnect. 1=persist our watches. 0=clean up after our connection
        unixSocketPath is a path to a path on the local filesystem that is a unix socket that the host engine is listening on.
                       This option is mutually exclusive with ipAddress
        timeoutMs is how long to wait for TCP/IP or Unix domain connections to establish in ms. 0=Default timeout (5000ms)
